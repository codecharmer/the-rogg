Walker is the 45th Governor of Wisconsin and was first elected to the office in 2010. During his first term, Walker proposed Wisconsin Act 10, which restricted the ability of public workers to engage in public bargaining. The act drew massive protests, mainly organized by unions. Opponents of the measure successfully forced Walker to face a recall election on June 5, 2012. Walker survived the recall election, defeating Tom Barrett(D) 53 percent to 46 percent. In doing so, Walker became the first governor to survive a recall. He then won re - election on November 4, 2014. Prior to serving as governor, Walker was a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly from 1993 to 2002 and Milwaukee County Executive from 2002 to 2010. He attended Marquette University, but he did not earn his bachelor's degree, choosing instead to leave school for a job with the American Red Cross during his senior year. He explained the decision saying, \"The reason I went to college, in large part, was not just to get an education for an education's sake, but to get a job. Someday, maybe in the next few years, I'll embark on finishing my degree.” Walker filed paperwork with the Federal Election Commission on July 2, 2015. However, he did not officially announce his campaign until July 13, 2015. Walker released an early morning video on social media confirming his run for the presidency. Previously, when asked on December 1, 2013, if he was considering entering the presidential race, Walker said, \"I'm running for governor... we'll see what happens after that. I've got to look at my state... for now I'm focused on being governor.\" Then, on February 5, 2015, when Martha Raddatz asked if he will run for president, Walker said, \"I'll just tell you one thing. After three elections for governor in four years in a state that hasn't gone Republican since 1984 for president, I wouldn't bet against me on anything.\" In recent candidate rankings, Crowdpac ranked Walker as an 8.8C(C being conservative) on a scale ranging from 10L to 10C, making him the third most conservative Republican presidential candidate.
