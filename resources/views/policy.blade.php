    <h3>Digital Millennium Copyright Act</h3>

    <p>
        It is our policy to respond to notices of alleged infringement that comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (found at the U.S. Copyright Office) and other applicable intellectual property laws. It is our policy to remove material from public view that we believe in good faith to be copyrighted material that has been illegally copied and distributed by any of our members or users. It is also our policy to terminate the accounts of repeat offenders. If we remove or disable access to comply with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act we will make a good-faith attempt to contact the owner, author, or administrator of each affected site so that they may make a counter notification pursuant to sections 512(g)(2) and (3) of that Act.

    </p>

    <p>To expedite our ability to process your request, please use the following format:</p>

    <p>Title of the specific thread or article that contains the copyrighted work. Post number of the specific post that contains the copyrighted work. Link to the specific post (available via the "this post" link on each post) or article you believe contains the copyrighted material. Specific nature of the copyright infringement you believe is occurring. Details of your claim to the material, or your relationship to the material copyright holder. Provide your full name, address, and telephone number should we need to clarify your claim. Provide a working email address where we can contact you to confirm your claim.

    <p>We will review your claim and determine its merit. If, after our review, we believe your claim is sufficient to remove the information from public view, we will do so immediately and provide you with confirmation.
